# Artistry on Demand

**Artistry on Demand**, aims to create a dynamic platform that connects artists with users seeking personalized art services, such as sketches, animated videos, and custom-made greetings. The platform will allow artists to create profiles, add and manage their art listings, and showcase their work to potential customers. Users will be able to browse these listings, make requests based on their preferences, and modify or cancel their requests within a specified time frame. The system will also enable secure user authentication and include a feedback mechanism to help drive more business to artists by showcasing positive reviews. As part of future enhancements, payment integration will be implemented, ensuring a seamless experience for both artists and customers. Overall, our project aims to bridge the gap between creators and consumers in the art industry through an intuitive, secure, and efficient platform.
